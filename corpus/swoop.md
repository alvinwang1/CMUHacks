What is a vending machine business?
Vending machines are standalone cash or card-operated devices that sell a wide range of products to consumers. A vending machine business is an organization that manages one or more of these machines – usually as the equipment owner, but sometimes as a franchisee. 

Vending machines can be found in many different locations, from airports and strip malls to colleges and theme parks. Dispensing candy, sodas, snacks, healthy foods, tech equipment, beauty products and more, these machines can provide a low-cost entry point to a lucrative business opportunity. The US vending machine market was worth more than $15billion in 2022 and over 100million people buy from vending machines every single day.

Vending machine operators are responsible for purchasing or renting the machines, finding the best locations to place the devices, keeping them stocked with fast-selling products and collecting the cash they generate. Depending on the number of machines you run, a vending machine business can be operated as a part-time or full-time operation. 

Best-selling vending machine products in 2022:

Sodas and cold drinks – they make up almost 40% of all US vending sales
Snacks and candy – the Snickers bar is the number one treat sold by vending machine
Hot drinks and specialty beverages – the drinks sector is rapidly expanding beyond the soda can
Fresh foods, sandwiches and fruits – health-conscious consumers are driving new demand
Tech and gadgets – hugely popular in airports, train stations and bus stations

Are vending machine businesses profitable?
Yes, they are. After buying the equipment, the typical vending machine will deliver a 20% to 25% net profit margin and generate $300 to $600 profit per month depending on location and the type of products it sells. If that doesn’t sound like much, multiply by x 10 machines and you could be collecting $3,000 to $6,000 net profit per month, or $36,000 to $72,000 per year. Additionally, keep in mind that you may not need an office or even a storage space for inventory to run a vending machine business, and if you’re prepared to keep your machines full of products and collect the cash yourself, you will also have zero employee costs eating into income.

What are the costs for a vending machine business?
Costs to operate a vending machine business fall into two categories:

Capital costs
This is the cost of the machine and any financing charges you may incur if you buy the equipment with a loan. Even old vending machines can have good re-sale values, so this cost is classed as an investment, and the machine is a depreciating business asset.

Operating costs
This is what it costs to keep the machine working and selling products. Operating costs include:

Rent to the location owner – for example, a convenience store. This may be a flat fee per month, or a share of your sales.

Electricity costs if your machine is not purely mechanical – some location owners may bundle this into the rent.

Stock – this is wholesale price of the products you sell and any shipping charges and taxes you may need to pay.

Servicing – if you’re not good at mechanics, you will probably need to pay a service agent or repairman from time to time to keep your equipment operating at 100%.

Insurance – you’ll need equipment insurance to protect against theft, vandalism and other unpredictable events. You will also need public liability cover to protect you from lawsuits that customers may bring if they claim your machine or the products it sells has harmed them or their property.

Upgrades – the way we buy things is changing rapidly. Older, cash-only vending machines are being phased out by devices that take payment from cards and smartphones. Even coins and dollar bills are periodically updated. Depending on the age of the equipment you buy, you may need to upgrade your machines to accept new ways for customers to pay.

Permits and licenses – some states and cities may require you to buy a permit or license to operate each machine.

Taxes – you may have to collect and pay state and city taxes on your sales. This cost will vary according to the location of your machines.

Management costs – this is things like the gasoline and other travel costs you incur to keep your machines stocked and collect the cash they make, plus control costs, such as vending machine software to maintain your inventory.

What are the types of vending machine businesses?
If it will fit in the machine and you can find a market for it, vending machines can sell almost anything. The four main types of vending machine business sectors are:

Food and drinks  
Bulk vending
Specialty vending
Franchised vending
It is important to do your research before opting for a specific sector and buying a machine. Different products may require utilities and features such as electricity, water, refrigeration or Wi-Fi to operate successfully. Also check out what is selling in the area where you intend to place the equipment – for example, an office block or hospital is a good spot for hot drinks, snacks and sandwiches – and take the time to discover what the foot traffic is like – the best machine locations sell to people all day long, not just during lunchtime or rush hour.  

Once you’ve spotted some likely machine locations and judged the foot traffic, it’s best to select one product sector and stick to it. That way you can restrict the types of machines you need and you’ll learn more about your customers, the sales cycle, what products are top sellers, etc. Only when you’ve established your business should you think about expanding – for example placing a soda machine next to your snacks machine to satisfy both food and drinks customers. 

Snacks, food, and beverage vending
With soda and cold drinks alone making up almost 40% of vending machine sales, the snacks, food and beverage vending sector is by far the biggest in the US. For entrepreneurs looking to enter the vending machine industry, sticking with these tried and trusted products can reduce your business risk. 

However, it’s not all about the soda can. You can buy machines that offer drinks, snacks, or a combination of both, (the top five selling vending machine items in 2023 are candy bars, chocolate bars, chips, pretzels and gum), but even here there’s room for innovation. You could move away from selling pop, candy bars and chips to provide different forms of drinks, treats and snacks. Modern consumers are increasingly buying flavored waters, cold caffeine-based drinks and variations of milk, high-energy, and diet-based options. You could also consider a product line that targets health-conscious consumers, offering products as varied as fresh fruit, granola bars, salads, yoghourts and vegetarian wraps. 

Most importantly you should target your food and drinks range to the locations where you operate. For instance, a gym may be a great place to sell energy bars and electrolytes drinks, but in a business park you may do better selling coffee, sandwiches and proven, lunchtime favorites.

Bulk vending
Vending machines that sell bubblegum, toys, balls and kids’ stickers are known as bulk vending. These machines are typically low-maintenance, all-mechanical devices, selling their products for modest prices usually paid in cash. With long-life products and no need for electricity or batteries, bulk vending machines are ideal for business owners seeking an opportunity that requires minimal time or cash investment and that generates good, passive income. Used bulk vending equipment can be purchased for as low as $50 per unit and if placed in the right location – such as near a school or in an amusement park – and selling the right product, they can drive income of up to $30 per month. 

Top tip: Used bulk vending machines can often be old and worn, so check them over thoroughly before purchasing and factor in a budget for repair or upgrade costs.

Specialty vending
Everybody has to eat and drink, but specialty vending machines can cater to many other markets. Depending on your machine location, you could consider selling products as varied as:

Retail
Tech gadgets and accessories, such as cables, chargers and ear plugs are big sellers in airports, bus and train stations, as are machines that dispense books, magazines and newspapers. Some shopping malls and department stores also provide machines that sell high-end products, such as beauty products, sunglasses and jewelry, while arenas and stadiums are good spots for machines selling fan gear, souvenirs, seat cushions, ponchos and rainwear.

Laundry products
Laundromats, apartment blocks, dorms, motels and hotels are ideal locations for selling detergents, dyes, dryer sheets and other laundry essentials. You could also expand this basic range by providing emergency sewing kits, dyes and packs of buttons. 

Hot drinks
Coffee on the go is a huge industry in the US and it’s not only coffee shops getting in on the action. Sophisticated coffee vending machines, often selling a range of products from filter to cappuccino, plus teas and hot chocolate, are taking a growing share of revenues. Top locations for these type of machines are office blocks and business parks, but hospitals, bus stations, the DMV and car washes are also strong contenders.

Tobacco products
In many states it is legal to sell cigarettes and other tobacco products, including vapes, via vending machines. Although these types of sale make up a small part of overall vending machine revenues, they can be very lucrative depending on the levels of taxation. Top spots for such machines include bars, casinos, bowling alleys, transit stations and motels.

What’s the difference between a vending machine and an automated retail machine?
Automated retail machines are new entrants to the vending machine market. Often located in up-scale locations and delivering a luxury sales experience, they are changing the way we buy products without human intervention. But how are they different from the humble vending machine?

Vending machines have remained largely unchanged for decades and they sell many types of product with pure focus on the sale. ARMs are state-of-the-art devices that usually showcase a range of products from one manufacturer, aiming to generate brand awareness as much as sales.
The typical vending machine sale is less than $10. A typical ARM sale is $20 – $200.
Vending machines rely on electronics and old-school mechanicals. ARMs work using robotics, electronics and more often, intuitive AI.
It’s common for vending machines to jam when dispensing products or lose the customer’s money. ARMs use laser guided systems to dispense products and card or smartphone technology for payments. ARMs almost never jam or lose the customer’s money.
Franchise opportunities
Buying into a vending machine franchise can give you entry to an established network, corporate backing for products, extensive training, and services and support to secure suitable machine locations. It can also give you options on how many machines you wish to operate and sometimes, financing to buy or lease them. However, keep in mind that as well as the upfront joining fee, franchisors will often dictate what you can and cannot sell, may restrict where you buy your inventory and will take a share of your profits in exchange for your license.

Vending machine business ideas
As vending machines and consumer tastes evolve, there is scope to provide many different products and services. Some machine vendors are already thinking outside the vending box with ideas such as these:

Burgers, pizza and fries – fast food without the food truck or restaurant
Pet foods, snacks, toys and medicines
Hams and cured meats – everything from bacon to salami and steaks
Sushi – popular in Japan for ages, now expanding across the US
Hair products – everything to keep male and female hair looking great
Fresh vegetables – brings the produce aisle to your street corner
Nutrients and proteins – muscling in on the fitness sector to keep athletes in top form
Fresh flowers – no more shopping at the gas station on Mothers’ Day

How much do vending machines cost?
Depending on the type of machine you buy, and if it is new or used, vending machines can cost from $50 for a used and basic dispenser, up to $10,000 for a brand new automated snack/retail machine.

Most experts suggest buying used machines to start with, typically spending $1,200 to $3,000 depending on device sophistication. On top of this you will have to pay rent for your location, buy stock and pay for services such as insurance, repairs and maintenance. With a low-cost location and a machine with few sophisticated features and selling simple products such as candy, sodas and snacks, it may be possible to get a vending machine business up and running for as little as $2,000.

Can you get a small business loan to buy a vending machine?
Yes. Small business loans, asset financing and equipment loans can all be used to buy one or more vending machines. You may also be able to lease the machines with an option to buy at the end of the contract. Purchase your vending machines over 1,2, 3 or more years. 

Can you get a loan to start a vending machine business?
Yes. As well as covering the cost of your vending machines, a small business loan, start-up loan, franchise financing or business acquisition loan can get your new vending machine business truly off the ground. Use the funds to pay location costs and cover inventory, licenses and permits, repairs and upgrades, marketing and more.

Is a vending machine business plan to essential get funding?
Not always. However, having a comprehensive business plan will certainly improve your chances of success and speed up the loan process. Most lenders will ask to see financial records if your business is already trading, as well as a list of personal assets and any existing debts you may have. Your credit report and score will also factor into the decision making, so be sure to check this information before you apply to ensure it is up to date and accurate. 

If you are unsure about the best way to fund your vending machine purchases, don’t be afraid to seek expert advice. You can start that process here.

Things to consider when buying vending machines
Type of machine – Different products require different types of vending machines – for example, a hot drinks machine will need power, water and waste connections. Some machines may also need wi-fi to make payments with cards or phones. Choose the right machine to sell your product range without paying for expensive features you may never use.
Location – This is as important as the type of machine you buy. Find a location that will suit your product range – for example, an airport to sell tech gadgets – and measure the space your machine will occupy and what connections it may need – such as electricity. If you can only secure space for a countertop machine, there’s no point in buying a free-standing unit. Always remember: Location first, machine type second.
Costs – If you’re starting out, you should keep to a strict budget. Used and refurbished machines may be the more cost-effective way to go, even if they need some cleaning up and repairs.
Easy to use – Vending machines that are effortless to use will generate more sales than complicated devices that take an age to understand. Keep it simple, so even kids can use your machine.
Safety – Injuries caused by vending machines are quite rare, but if they happen, they can result in large compensation claims that may not be covered by your insurance. Make sure your machines have no obvious safety hazards and that they can be secured to the wall, floor or countertop to prevent them toppling over.
Should I buy new or used vending machines?
It depends on your budget. Experts recommend starting out with used machines to keep capital costs down, then upgrading to newer machines as your business grows.

The best questions to ask before buying a vending machine
Some questions apply to new and used vending machines:

Is this machine credit card compatible? 
Does the Bill Acceptor take 1s, 5s, 10s? 
What is the capacity of the machine – for example, how many drinks/snacks will it carry?  
What utilities does it require – power, water, waste, wi-fi?
What special features does the machine have?
How long is the guarantee – and does it include labor and parts?
And some questions are for used vending machines only:

Why are you selling the machine? 
How old is the machine?  
Have there been any repairs to the machine?
Do you have the manual for the machine?

Where to find vending machines for sale:
If you’re going to launch a vending machine business, you’re going to need a machine or two. Luckily, there are many ways to find vending machines for sale:

Online retailers
Consumer platforms like Ebay, Craigslist, even Amazon, have thousands of vending machines for sale. These sites may be the best place for first-time buyers to select their machine, as it will give you the broadest equipment selection and the widest range of prices. Remember that vending machines are often large and heavy, so keep your search local to minimize the shipping or pick-up costs.

Classified ads
Some of the vending machine industry publications, such as Vending Times or the publications you’ll find listed here, carry small ads with machines and accessories for sale. These ads tend to be from operators and machine dealers, so the machines they sell may be a little more expensive than you’ll find on Ebay, but they may come with a warranty and the seller may be more helpful and provide more detail about the machines than your typical online vendor.

Auctions & liquidations
The same publications listed above, plus your own online search will reveal upcoming auctions and liquidations of vending businesses and equipment. Although you can sometimes snap up a bargain here, keep in mind that you will be bidding against seasoned pros who know what the machines are worth. Additionally, auction sites sell under a ‘buyer beware’ disclaimer, meaning it’s up to you to check the machines before buying. You can’t claim for problems you discover after purchase unless the auction listing was deliberately misleading. Don’t forget to factor in added auction fees and taxes.

Social media and word of mouth
Social media, message boards and even business sites like Linked In can be useful places to dig up machines for sale that are not listed elsewhere. If you can, place your own ad stating what you need, or simply put out a request to your network.

Local suppliers
Most towns and cities will have local suppliers to the vending machine industry. Typically, they will sell machines, accessories, parts and supplies. Your equipment options may be more limited here, but you will usually have the chance to check the machines out in person and discover their history. Some local suppliers also work as agents for the big distributors, so they may be able to recommend machines to fit your specific needs. 

Repair shops
Vending machines break down like every other device. When they do, they usually need a specialist to fix what’s gone wrong. As above, most towns and cities will have at least one vending machine repair shop and they’re a good place to learn more about the types of machines you need and get the skinny on machines they know are for sale, or operators and dealers you should talk to.

Top tip: Check out the vending machines selling near you. Often, they will have a sticker on the side that reveals the name and number of the service agent or repair shop that takes care of the device. Failing that there will usually be a sticker or plate that provides the details of the machine operator. You may be able to call them and ask where the best used or new machines can be purchased in your local area.

Vending machine distributers
These are the major suppliers of new and used machines, often covering the whole state or even selling  nationally. They will have the widest selection of vending machines for sale, the newest technology, and the most end-to-end services for delivery, repairs, and training. However, this is also the most expensive option, and equipment purchased through vending franchises might require a minimum order of multiple machines and/or other fees that go toward machine servicing and entrepreneur development programs.

Owning a vending business
If you’ve got the determination, a vehicle and a few thousand dollars, you’re all set to start your own vending business. But before you jump in, what are advantages and disadvantages of this sort of venture?

Pros
Advantages

Cheap to run
Vending machine businesses have few overheads apart from paying location rent. You usually don’t need an office or a warehouse. Also, if you’re stocking the machine and collecting the cash yourself, you have no need for employees, which means no payroll or benefits expenses.

Many product choices
Vending machines can sell almost anything that fits inside the box. You can operate multiple machines selling different types of product. This gives you a buffer against changing consumer tastes as well as the opportunity to quickly pivot to new products if they suddenly start to trend.

Easy to scale
You don’t have to go ‘all-in’ at the start. You can launch with just one machine and then add more as your sales grow and you gain market experience.

Cons
Disadvantages

Theft and vandalism
Many vending machines are vulnerable to attack by street thieves and mischief makers. Theft and vandalism are common events. Always insure your machines against these types of crime and of you can, place them in locations where they are secure or under 24/7 surveillance.

Time commitment
You’ll need to commit time to selecting your machines, securing locations, replenishing the products and gathering the cash you earn. The more machines you have, the more time this will take. 

What is the best way to fund a vending machine business?
Unless you’re buying a used gumball machine, you can expect to pay $1,200 to $3,000 for your first machine and then pay for location costs and inventory. If you don’t have the cash to do this, you can fund your vending machine business by other means:

Equipment loans and leasing
Loans to buy or lease vending machines can cover the major equipment cost and sometimes pay for servicing. Loans usually pay back over 1 to 3 years. Lease finance contracts may give you the option to buy the equipment for as little as $1 at the end of the contract.

Small business loans and start-up loans
Finance to cover equipment costs, location fees, inventory, servicing, marketing and more.

Franchising
Gives you the support of a bigger franchise partner and may provide a protected territory to operate in. Franchising usually requires a large payment upfront (the joining fee) and then you pay a flat fee or a share of turnover on a weekly or monthly basis after that. Franchise financing can help to cover the joining fee and other start-up costs.

Bring in an investor/partner
If you don’t have a friend, relative or colleague who can join you in the venture you can find investors looking for investment opportunities on various angel investor websites. Always do your due diligence on any investor or partner that you do not know personally, and never pay for introductions or the chance to pitch your proposal.

Crowd funding
Online sites can connect you and your business proposal to hundreds or even thousands of private donors who may provide small amounts of cash to help you succeed. You will need a compelling story to make this option work, but if it does, you do not have to repay the cash as long as you spend it where you said you would. It’s basically free money.

Top tip: Always check the small print on any loan note or contract. Ideally, run it by a lawyer before you sign on the dotted line. 

How to take over an existing vending machine business
If you don’t want to start a new vending machine business, you could buy an existing operation. This would provide you with an instant network and save you from sourcing machines and negotiating locations. Simply follow these steps to buy an existing vending machine business:

Research the market – learn about the demand for vending machines in your target area. What products are popular, where are the machines sited, what kind of equipment is being used?
Set a budget – not just for the initial purchase, but to cover stock, servicing and location costs.
Find a business for sale – online sites and vending machine publications are a good place to find a vending machine business that matches your needs.
Do your due diligence – ask the seller about the business, scrutinize their records, search for any pending lawsuits, check permits and taxes are up to date.
Agree a price – don’t pay more than you are comfortable with, there will always be other opportunities.
Get funding – if you need finance, search for the best business acquisition loans. Compare rates, terms and conditions before signing. If in doubt, ask an expert.
Close the deal – finalize the purchase, exchange contracts, transfer ownership. This may require you to transfer permits and licenses and record the business in your name with local and state authorities as well as the IRS.
Transition – work with the seller during the agreed transition period. Learn about the machines, the local market, your location owners etc. 
Scale the business – depending on the size and type of vending machine business you buy you may be able to expand the operation with more machines and different products.
